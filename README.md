# Introduction To Data Visualization

Visualizing your data can be a highly effective way to communicate your research results to a wide variety of audiences.  This workshop covers best practices in converting your data into effective charts and graphs (i.e., visualizations). We will discuss how to get started, ways to tell your dataâ€™s story visually and how to thoughtfully use all the tools at your disposal.  We will also work through hands-on examples using Python and the Python package matplotlib. (No prior Python knowledge is required, though may be beneficial.)
