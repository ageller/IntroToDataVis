# Introduciton To Data Visualization

This workshop covers best practices in converting your data into effective charts and graphs (i.e., visualizations).  We will discuss how to get started, ways to tell your dataâ€™s story visually and how to thoughtfully use all the tools at your disposal.  Then we will work through a hands-on example using python and matplotlib.  (No prior python knowledge is required, though may be beneficial.)
 
If you don't have Python installed on your computer, but want to run the notebook, you can use the [version on Google colab linked here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TjL8rz4loNRwFl6IlJbxFAT5uve0fU17?usp=sharing)
